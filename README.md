# wordle-plus
A simple clone of Wordle with added stats, originally created for my Freshman Fall Intro to Programming class in 2024.

# Tech Stack
Python

# How To Play
Run wordleplus_.py to play. To play the game the user guesses a real 5 letter word, their guess is then
compared to the computer selected word, if the user’s guessed word has a letter that is in the computer’s
word then it is shown in yellow and if the letter is also in the correct place it is shown in green. Then the
user is prompted for another guess until they guess the computer’s word. If the user guesses the word in 6
guesses then they win and are shown a recap of their game, otherwise the user loses.
